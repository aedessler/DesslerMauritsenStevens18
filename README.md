code from this ACP paper

the file processCMIP.py is a python2.7 program that processes the raw netCDF files from the CMIP5 archive and creates
files to be used in creation of the figures in the paper.

the files figX.ipynb are python3 notebooks; each file creates Fig. X.

data needed to generate for most of the figures can be found at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Yo14kKvD3zfC8Ma00juyH7n09JvnSeOm
